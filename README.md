# Songs List Pro
Songs List Pro lets users customize a songs playlist from a curated list of songs that you the cloner has created. It comes with some sample songs already preloaded, just simply edit the 'songs-list-pro-songs.js' file and replace them with your own songs. Each song js object has a id, title, artist, duration and src. The unique id as well as the src are required parameters, title, artist and duration are optional. Songs List Pro is written entirely in JavaScript so there aren't any dependencies.
